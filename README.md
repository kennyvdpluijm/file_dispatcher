# file_dispatcher
Code that dispatches your files to the corresponding folder. 

Created this code to replace some brainless routine steps during my work. Files must be placed into the corresponding folders. Instead of selecting the file, searching for the folder and dragging it into the folder, now files can be dragged to the upload button and automatically be dispatched (uploaded) to the corresponding folder. An important criteria is, that the folder must have the same reference mentioned in the file.
Created this code with library Flask so that other people could work with it in their browsers. Note that it currently only works via the local server.
